Ore-Generation-API-Etude
========================

Ore Generation API Ã‰tude

This mod refactors the ore generation being used in OnlySilver into an API. Only the Etude class, the OreGenAPI class and the tester classes located in the testers package are new. The OreGenerator class would be the same as the one in OnlySilver.

I would suggest you to install and run this mod once first (including the testers contained in the testers sub-package), and have a look at the config file to see how the generated config look like.
